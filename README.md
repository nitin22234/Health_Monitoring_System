# Arduino-Based Health Monitoring System

![Project Image](link_to_image)

## Overview

This Arduino-based health monitoring system is designed to measure vital signs such as heart rate (beats per minute) and body temperature. It utilizes Arduino microcontrollers along with sensors to collect data from the user and display it in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- Measures heart rate (beats per minute) using a heart rate sensor.
- Monitors body temperature using a temperature sensor.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Hardware Components 

- Arduino Uno board
- Heart rate sensor
- Temperature sensor(LM 35)]
- Bluetooth(HC05)
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Software 
- Application in Java

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the sensors and display to the Arduino board according to the provided schematics or diagrams.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the Arduino code provided in the `Code` directory to your Arduino board.
3. **Power On**: Power on the Arduino board.
4. **Monitor Vitals**: Once powered on, the system will start monitoring heart rate and body temperature.
5. **Application**: The application is connected to project with bluetooth sensor(HC05) and displays vitals on screen.
